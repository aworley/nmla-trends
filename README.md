# nmla-trends
A case data trends analysis tool for legal services.  Developed by New Mexico Legal Aid under an LSC grant.

## Installation Notes
The cron_jobs directory contains a client script for submitting the data, and a script for crunching the numbers and generating the trends data.  Both should run nightly.  

The sql directory contains an empty copy of the database needed by the website.

The www directory contains the web site.  A copy of the Zend PHP library needs to be downloaded and placed in the www/nmtrends/library/ directory.
